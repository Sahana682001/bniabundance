Growing up, I witnessed various Vastu and astrology experts guiding my family, sparking my curiosity about the logical foundations behind these ancient practices. This curiosity led me to explore MahaVastu, where I uncovered that these sciences are rooted in ancient Indian Scriptures and were even embraced by kings of India. This discovery, motivated me to start my journey in this field where I became a certified Vastu Acharya, a certified trainer of MahaVastu in Feb 2020 and a Mentor in Jan 2021. I have been recognised and awarded as the Best Consultant South and Best Mentor South for the year 2022& 2023 by the founder of MahaVastu, Dr. Khushdeep Bansal. We work extensively on analysing the presence of 5 elements (Space, Water, Air, Fire and Earth), studying the attributes of 32 entrance effects and 16 zones (as against 8 directions), effects of various objects (like entrances, toilets, bed placement, burner, safe etc) placement and found ways of balancing them without making any structural changes/ Demolition ( since structural changes are impractical in the modern scenario of apartments and flats). In addition to this the correlation between  astrological readings and Vaastu have been established and hence now Vastu for any building can be customised based on the astrological readings of the occupants which is termed as Astro-Vastu. Having joined Dr.Khushdeep Bansal's core team in July 2021 provided me with the invaluable opportunity to work closely with him, the founder of MahaVastu, allowing me to refine my skills under the direct guidance of this esteemed figure in the field.",
